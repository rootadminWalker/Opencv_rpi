# Opencv: Age of computer vision

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opencv, stands for [**Open** Source **C**omputer **V**ision library](http://www.opencv.org), was a powerful library used by the world for a few reasons:
1. Fully open source
    * This makes it open for **the whole world**. People from the world could give it a
    fresh update if a bug appeared.
      
1. Written in C/C++
    * It's quite fast with it's programming language. Even with a python wrapper
    
1. Portable
    * Since every OS are based on C, Opencv can run on almost every OS (At least ones you know)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As opencv's website said:
> OpenCV has a modular structure, which means that the package includes several
> shared or static libraries.
